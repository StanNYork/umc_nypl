				<p>UMC has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic milestones. <br> It is the only private company ever to return a spacecraft from low-Earth orbit, which it first accomplished in December 2010.
                <br> The company made history again in May 2012 when its UMC spacecraft delivered cargo to and from the International Space Station.</p>

            <br>
            <p>A Mars sample return mission (MSR) would be a spaceflight mission to collect rock and dust samples from Mars and to return them to Earth. Sample return would be a very powerful type of exploration, because analysis is freed from the time, budget, and space constraints of spacecraft sensors. Any of Earth's laboratories could study a sample. <br>
            The return of Mars samples would be beneficial to science by allowing more extensive analysis to be undertaken of the samples than could be done by instruments painstakingly transferred to Mars. Also, the presence of the samples on Earth would allow scientific equipment to be used on stored samples, even years and decades after the sample return mission. One source of Mars samples is what are believed to be Martian meteorite's, which are rocks from Mars that made their way to Earth.  
            <br> A first step in this was one particular proposal, a joint project between NASA and ESA called ExoMars, would launch in 2018[3][21] with unspecified missions to return the sample itself expected in the 2020â€“2022 time frame.

     <table>
  <tr>
    <td> <p>Modular robots are a new breed of robots that are designed to increase the utilization of robots by modularizing their architecture. The functionality and effectiveness of a modular robot is easier to increase compared to conventional robots. These robots are composed of a single type of identical, several different identical module types, or similarly shaped modules, which vary in size. Their architectural structure allows hyper-redundancy for modular robots, as they can be designed with more than 8 degrees of freedom (DOF). Creating the programming, inverse kinematics and dynamics for modular robots is more complex than with traditional robots. Modular robots may be composed of L-shaped modules, cubic modules, and U and H-shaped modules. ANAT technology, an early modular robotic technology patented by Robotics Design Inc., allows the creation of modular robots from U and H shaped modules that connect in a chain, and are used to form heterogeneous and homogenous modular robot systems. 
        </p></td>
    <td> <p>These "ANAT robots" can be designed with "n" DOF as each module is a complete motorized robotic system that folds relatively to the modules connected before and after it in its chain, and therefore a single module allows one degree of freedom. The more modules that are connected to one another, the more degrees of freedom it will have. L-shaped modules can also be designed in a chain, and must become increasingly smaller as the size of the chain increases, as payloads attached to the end of the chain place a greater strain on modules that are further from the base. ANAT H-shaped modules do not suffer from this problem, as their design allows a modular robot to distribute pressure and impacts evenly amongst other attached modules, and therefore payload-carrying capacity does not decrease as the length of the arm increases. Modular robots can be manually or self-reconfigured to form a different robot, that may perform different applications.

				<p>The spacecraft pilot is the astronaut who directly controls the operation of a spacecraft, while located within that same craft (not remotely). <br> This term derives directly from the usage of the word "pilot" in aviation, <br>where it is synonymous with "aviator". Note that on the N.A.S.A  <br> Space Shuttle, the term "pilot" is analogous to the term "co-pilot" in aviation, as the "commander" has ultimate responsibility for the shuttle.</p>

				<p>The solar system is made up of the sun and everything that orbits around it, including planets,  <br> moons, asteroids, comets and meteoroids. It extends from the sun, called Sol by the ancient Romans, and goes past the four inner planets,  <br>through the Asteroid Belt to the four gas giants and on to the disk-shaped Kuiper Belt and far beyond to the giant, <br> spherical Oort Cloud and the teardrop-shaped heliopause. <br>Scientists estimate that the edge of the solar system is about 9 billion miles (15 billion kilometers) from the sun.</p>

    <td> <p>For millennia, astronomers have followed points of light that seemed to move among the stars. The ancient Greeks named these planets, meaning "wanderers." Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were known in antiquity, and the invention of the telescope added the Asteroid Belt, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto and many of these worlds' moons. 
    Astronomers are now hunting for another planet in our solar system, a true ninth planet, after evidence of its existence was unveiled on Jan. 20, 2016. The so-called "Planet Nine," as scientists are calling it, is about 10 times the mass of Earth and 5,000 times the mass of Pluto. 
        </p></td>
    <td> <p>The four inner four planets â€” Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars â€” are made up mostly of iron and rock. They are known as terrestrial or earthlike planets because of their similar size and composition. Earth has one natural satellite â€” the moonâ€” and Mars has two moons â€” Deimos and Phobos.
    Between Mars and Jupiter lies the Asteroid Belt. Asteroids are minor planets, and scientists estimate there are more than 750,000 of them with diameters larger than three-fifths of a mile (1 km) and millions of smaller asteroids. The dwarf planet Ceres, about 590 miles (950 km) in diameter, resides here. A number of asteroids have orbits that take them closer into the solar system that sometimes lead them to collide with Earth or the other inner planets.
